# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
The investor, W. Avy, wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

## Results

After creating and running the datasets for the June and December data the below images are the results:

*  The minimum temperature for June was 64° and the min for December was 56° which is an 8° difference between the midpoints of the year

*  The maximum temperatures for June and December were 83° and 85° degrees respectively.

*  The mean temperature for the June was 75° and December was 71°. 


## Summary

> In reviewing the results, the minimum temperatures in June (64°) and December (56°) would suggest the temperature is mild enough to sustain a Surf and Ice Cream shop.  With the high-end temperatures only reaching 85° (June) and 83° (Dec) it doesn't appear to get hot enough to drive customers away where they would rather be in air-conditioning than out eating ice cream and surfing.  In looking at the quartile data for both months 75% of the time the temperature is 69° or greater which further confirms that the majority of the time the weather will excellent for the shop. Overall given the data that has been reviewed it would appear that the Surf and Ice Cream shop would have no issues due to the temperature.

> Additional Queries to help gather data for this analysis would be to analyze the amount of rainfall for each month to determine if the shop would need to close or have a low customer count due to bad weather.  With this data limited to just June and December, I would also recommend running this for each of the 12 months in the year and trending both the temperature and rainfall to make sure we are not missing anything.  Two out of twelve months seems like a small sample size to predict the success of a business that can be impacted by the weather.
