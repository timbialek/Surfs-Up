# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
The investor, W. Avy, wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

## Results

After creating and running the datasets for the June and December data the below images are the results:

*  The minimum temperature for June was 64° and the min for December was 56° which is an 8° difference between the midpoints of the year

*  The maximum temperatures for June and December were 83° and 85° degrees respectively.

*  The mean temperature for the June was 75° and December was 71°. 


## Summary

> In reviewing the results, the minimum temperature in June is 64° and December is 56°, which would suggest the temperature is mild enough to sustain a Surf and Ice Cream shop.  With the high-end temperatures only reaching 85° in June and 83° in December it doesn't appear to get hot enough that is would drive customers to the point where they they would rather be inside in air-conditioning than out eating ice cream and surfing.  In looking at the quartile data for both months 75% of the time the temperature is 69° or greater which further confirms that the majority of the time the weather will be excellent for the shop. Overall given the data that has been reviewed it would appear that the Surf and Ice Cream shop would have no issues due to the temperature.

> Additional Queries to help gather data for this evaluation would be to analyze the amount of rainfall for each month to determine if the shop might have bad customer turn out due to bad weather.  Humidity could also come into play and might be worth looking at also since it is a condition that might keep people inside in air conditioning.  I would also recommend running this for each of the 12 months in the year and trending both the temperature, rainfall and humidity to make sure we are not missing anything.  Two out of twelve months alos seems like a small sample size to predict the success of a business that can be impacted by the weather.
